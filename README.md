# Symmetric Encryption

Built a symmetric encryption code using Python Cryptography module. 
Symmetric Key is generated using Fernet. Same Key will be used to encrypt or decrypt file in a system.
Implemented Unit Test to test the code.
Used 'pyinstaller' module to package the file into a package.Copied the binary file from package into local user directory so that it can accessed anywhere from the system.
